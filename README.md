# HeptaFlip
A terminal based puzzle game based on the heptagram (a seven lined version of the [I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching "Ancient Chinese method of Divination") *[hexagram](https://www.iching-online.com/iching-trigrams.htm "Covers Trigrams and Hexagrams")*) coded in Rust.  
As one of the first things I have ever coded the project may be a little disorganised until I become more skilled.  
There are currently 49 levels where you have to deduce paterns to flip lines into their unbroken state.

## To-do

[X] Versatile codebase is needed to easily create new levels  
[ ] Add dynamic dialogue to the levels that adapts to how well you are doing  
[ ] Include ASCII character with the dialogue e.g. `/{'-'}\`  `-{'o'}-`  `\{^-^}/`  `~{'-'}Â¬`
