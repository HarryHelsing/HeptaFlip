# HeptaFlip
A terminal based puzzle game based on the heptagram (a seven lined version of the [I Ching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Ching "Ancient Chinese method of Divination") hexagram) coded in Rust.
*Just to let you know this is one of the first things I have ever coded!*
My aim is to create a game with many levels and dialogue.

## To-do

[X] Versatile codebase is needed to easily create new levels
[ ] Add dynamic dialogue to the levels that adapts to how well you are doing
[ ] Include ASCII character with the dialogue e.g. `/{'-'}\`  `-{'o'}-`  `\{^-^}/`  `~{'-'}Â¬`
