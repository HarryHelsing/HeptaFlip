# HeptaFlip
A terminal based puzzle game based on the heptagram (a seven lined version of the I Ching hexagram) coded in Rust
Just to let you know this is one of the first things I have ever coded!

My aim is to create a game with many levels and dialogue
Firstly a versatile codebase is needed to easily create new levels
