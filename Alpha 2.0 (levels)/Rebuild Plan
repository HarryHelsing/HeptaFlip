Create enums for the different gamestates

    introduction,
    lvlactive,
    lvlfinish,
    ending,
    (Perhaps lvlwin would be a helpful function)
    
Attach function for each enum that does the role of each state

  What each state needs to be able to do:
  
    introduction
Introductory text with 'print!' perhaps demonstrating the Heptagram and explaining how to play.
Finally ends with changing the gamestate to the lvlactive enum/function.

    lvlactive
Bulk of the game.
Needs to check the lvlnumber variable to know how to set up the heptagram and correct controls.
Also needs to be able to check for win condition.
Once win condition is reached changes the level variable
If the round was done in the fewest turns then adds +1 to perfection variable (affects dialogue)
Switches to lvlfinish enum

    lvlfinish
Displays dialogue based upon perfection variable and level variable
Finally puts back into lvlactive state or if applicable ending state

    ending
Displays message which changes depending on level of perfection points then exits game

Variable needed and their roles

    lvlnumber,
    perfection,
    turns,
    
    lvlnumber
Keeps track of the current level

    perfection
Keeps track of how many perfect levels (completed in fewest turns) have been achieved

    turns
